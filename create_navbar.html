                <div class="article_description">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</div>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text since 1500, when an unknown printer took a sample and created a sample book. It not only survived for five centuries, but it remained basically unchanged even after making the leap into electronic media. It became popular in the 1960s with the release of the letter containing the Letraset Lorem Ipsum excerpt, and recently became more prevalent with desktop publishing software, including versions of Aldus PageMaker Lorem Ipsum.</div>
